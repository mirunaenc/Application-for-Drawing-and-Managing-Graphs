# Application-for-Drawing-and-Managing-Graphs
## Project Description
This project focuses on creating and manipulating graphs using Java and Swing. The primary features include ensuring nodes do not overlap, drawing edges only between nodes, and saving the adjacency matrix of the drawn graph to a file. Users can choose between directed and undirected graphs, reposition nodes using the mouse, and save the graph data either continuously or at the end via a button.

## Technologies Used
Java: The core programming language used for developing the application.
Swing: The graphical user interface toolkit used for rendering the graph and handling user interactions.
